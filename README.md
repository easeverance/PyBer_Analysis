# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
We were tasked by V. Isualize to creating a summary DataFrame of ride sharing data by city type (Rural, Suburban, Urban).  With the information that was obtained to create a multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  Culminating in a written report that details the differences between city types based off of ridership, drivers, and revenue (fares $) and how this information can be utlized to drive future business decisions. 

# Results
After deep diving into the results it's very obvious that in rural areas there is a significant decrease in total rides, total drivers, and total amount of fares (revenue).

 As the above data shows there is 13 times the total amount of rides that occur in urban areas compared to rural.  There is nearly 30 times the number of drivers in urban areas compared to rural.  Finally there is almost the potential to make 9 times the revenue in urban areas compared to rural.  
 
 Not only is there the above discrepencies between urban and rural areas but also in the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver between urban and rural areas.

# Summary
Based off the the above analyis my recommendation to Pyber is that there is significant potential to increase revenue in rural and suburban areas with an increase in drivers.  The data shows that in rural areas the avearge fare per ride ($55.49)far exceed the average fare per ride for both urban and suburban areas ($16.57, $39.50 respectively).  This would instinctually lead one to believe that drivers are driving longer distances in rural areas compared to the other two.  The number of drivers in rual areas and suburban areas is significantly less than what is seen in the urban setting (78, 490, 2,405 respectively).  The drivers, especially in the rural areas, are tied up in long distance travel.  Therefore, not available to meet potential demand. With more drivers this would increase the total fares and ultimately total revenue for the company and for each driver.   In addition PyBer could potentially decrease the number of drivers to increase revenue per driver.  Looking at the data there seems to be a significant demand for drivers in urban areas.  Looking at a weekly entries between 1/1/2019 to 4/28/2019 out of 2,196 entries the urban city type had 1,509 and non non values compared to 114 and 573 for rural and suburban areas respectively.  This shows that drivers in urban areas are at a 68% utilization.  With a headcount reduction Pyber could drive up the utltilzation and at the same time increase the average fare by driver.
